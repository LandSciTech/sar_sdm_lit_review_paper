SAR-SDM_database_clean: The data needed to reproduce most of the analysis in the
paper. Each row is a listing document and matches with the format of the CAN-SAR
database.

SAR-SDM_paper_database_clean: The data extracted from each paper. Each row is a
unique combination of species and paper. This database may be helpful for
practitioners looking for SDM models for specific species.

Metadata files include definitions of all the columns in the databases and the
values used in them.
