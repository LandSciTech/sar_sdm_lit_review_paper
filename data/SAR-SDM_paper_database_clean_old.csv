Mexican overwintering populations have experienced significant mortality events recently, which have been hypothesized as increasing in frequency owing to climate change. Here, we test the hypothesis of climate-change causation of these mortality events, at least in part, finding significant local weather trends toward conditions lethal for monarch survival. We use ecological niche estimates and future climate projections to estimate future overwintering distributions; results anticipate dramatic reductions in suitability of present overwintering areas, and serious implications for local human economies.  ... Recent decades have seen several overwintering monarch mortality events apparently related to local weather (Brower et al., 2004): cold and wet conditions, particularly at night, and particularly when wet conditions immediately precede cold conditions, move monarchs into lethal physiological regimes that cannot be survived for more than a few hours. Experimental studies have elucidated tolerances of such conditions (Calvert et al., 1983; Gibo and McCurdy, 1993; Larsen and Lee, 1994; Anderson and Brower, 1996; Troyer et al., 1996; Alonso-Mejía et al., 1997). Although such events may have occurred in the past, one publication suggested that frequency will increase with current climate change (Oberhauser and Peterson, 2004), with possible consequences for survival of the concentrated overwintering phenomenon. In this contribution, we provide a partial test of these hypotheses of climate-change causation of winter mortality events.

Increases in temperature over the last century have clearly been linked to shifts in species distributions. Given the magnitude of projected future climatic changes, we can expect even larger range shifts in the coming century. These changes will, in turn, alter ecological communities and the functioning of ecosystems. Despite the seriousness of predicted climate change, the uncertainty in climate-change projections makes it difficult for conservation managers and planners to proactively respond to climate stresses. To address one aspect of this uncertainty, we identified predictions of faunal change for which a high level of consensus was exhibited by different climate models. Specifically, we assessed the potential effects of 30 coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) future-climate simulations on the geographic ranges of 2954 species of birds, mammals, and amphibians in the Western Hemisphere. ... Previous range-shift projections have also been limited by uncertainties in modeling approaches and overly simplistic estimates of extinction rates (Harte et al. 2004, Thuiller et al. 2004). Here, we use a consensus-based bioclimatic modeling approach that reduces model uncertainties to assess the potential effects of 30 different future climate simulations on the ranges of 1818 bird, 723 mammal, and 413 amphibian species in the Western Hemisphere. Instead of assessing extinction rates, our approach simply asks whether climatic conditions are predicted to shift so much that a species will not likely be found in a particular location (defined as a particular 50 3 50 km grid cell) in the future and whether new areas with suitable climatic conditions will emerge.

Using a large database of historic journal observations from northwest North America, we empirically test the hypothesis that bison populations in the Western Cordillera were limited by both low bottom-up habitat suitability and high top-down human harvest. First, we present historic information on bison and their potential primary predators [27–29]: humans, wolves (Canis lupus), and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis), using abundance and distribution data from a biome-scale record of the ﬁrst-person journals of early non-Indigenous travellers. Second, we conduct analyses of these data to test how bottom-up habitat suitability based on MaxEnt modelling and mixed-effect modelling of top-down processes, namely wolf and bear predation and human harvest, could have limited bison occurrence in the Western Cordillera. Third, we review the demographics and range areas of bison restored on the edge or outside of the historic range to further test whether the growth of these populations is limited by their location. We then discuss the restoration of bison in accordance with bottom-up and top-down ecological processes and long-term human inﬂuences.",0,NA,1,"1691-1860 & 1770-1928 (distribution data), 1961-1990 (climate)",0,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"2","1",NA,NA,0,"not exact species modelled",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Grove locations are known from recent and historical surveys and a long-term citizen science database. The climatic niche model performs well, predicting that overwintering habitat is most likely to occur along the coast and at low elevations, as shown by empirical data. We then use climatic variables in conjunction with climate change scenarios to model the future location of overwintering habitat, and find a substantial shift in the predicted distribution. ... The breeding ranges of both Eastern and Western monarch populations are predicted to shift northward [26] via climate change modifications to the geographic distribution of milkweed, the monarch’s obligate host. What about the geographic distribution of groves used by overwintering monarchs; will these be impacted by climate change? It is possible that the geographic range of the tree species that comprise overwintering groves in California could shift. But, it is also possible that conditions in monarch overwintering groves are direct or indirect correlates of climatic variables, such as temperature and precipitation. If so, then it is very likely that the overwintering range of monarch butterflies in California will shift. Unfortunately, it is also possible that proximity of overwintering sites to the ocean is essential, and that suitable climatic conditions will simply not be found away from the coastline. A test of this hypothesis (i.e., a climate niche model of overwintering locations as potentially modified by climate change), has yet to be constructed for monarch butterflies overwintering in Mexico or California....",0,NA,0,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,1

Increases in temperature over the last century have clearly been linked to shifts in species distributions. Given the magnitude of projected future climatic changes, we can expect even larger range shifts in the coming century. These changes will, in turn, alter ecological communities and the functioning of ecosystems. Despite the seriousness of predicted climate change, the uncertainty in climate-change projections makes it difficult for conservation managers and planners to proactively respond to climate stresses. To address one aspect of this uncertainty, we identified predictions of faunal change for which a high level of consensus was exhibited by different climate models. Specifically, we assessed the potential effects of 30 coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) future-climate simulations on the geographic ranges of 2954 species of birds, mammals, and amphibians in the Western Hemisphere. ... Previous range-shift projections have also been limited by uncertainties in modeling approaches and overly simplistic estimates of extinction rates (Harte et al. 2004, Thuiller et al. 2004). Here, we use a consensus-based bioclimatic modeling approach that reduces model uncertainties to assess the potential effects of 30 different future climate simulations on the ranges of 1818 bird, 723 mammal, and 413 amphibian species in the Western Hemisphere. Instead of assessing extinction rates, our approach simply asks whether climatic conditions are predicted to shift so much that a species will not likely be found in a particular location (defined as a particular 50 3 50 km grid cell) in the future and whether new areas with suitable climatic conditions will emerge.

To address one aspect of this uncertainty, we identified predictions of faunal change for which a high level of consensus was exhibited by different climate models. Specifically, we assessed the potential effects of 30 coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) future-climate simulations on the geographic ranges of 2954 species of birds, mammals, and amphibians in the Western Hemisphere. ... Previous range-shift projections have also been limited by uncertainties in modeling approaches and overly simplistic estimates of extinction rates (Harte et al. 2004, Thuiller et al. 2004). Here, we use a consensus-based bioclimatic modeling approach that reduces model uncertainties to assess the potential effects of 30 different future climate simulations on the ranges of 1818 bird, 723 mammal, and 413 amphibian species in the Western Hemisphere. Instead of assessing extinction rates, our approach simply asks whether climatic conditions are predicted to shift so much that a species will not likely be found in a particular location (defined as a particular 50 3 50 km grid cell) in the future and whether new areas with suitable climatic conditions will emerge.

Instead of assessing extinction rates, our approach simply asks whether climatic conditions are predicted to shift so much that a species will not likely be found in a particular location (defined as a particular 50 3 50 km grid cell) in the future and whether new areas with suitable climatic conditions will emerge.

Instead of assessing extinction rates, our approach simply asks whether climatic conditions are predicted to shift so much that a species will not likely be found in a particular location (defined as a particular 50 3 50 km grid cell) in the future and whether new areas with suitable climatic conditions will emerge.

Previous models demonstrated that climate change might drive northward shifts in both the northern and southern range limits of monarchs [22]. However, these models only examined the ecological niche of monarch larvae. Accurate predictions of future distributions require understanding the drivers of current species distributions before using this information to model species occurrences in the future. For example, species distributions of specialist lepidopterans may be determined more by host plant availability rather than environmental effects on lepidopteran physiology per se, such that modeling climate change effects on lepidopteran distributions requires first modeling climate change effects on host plant distributions. Here, I report the results of a study designed to assess the effects of climate change on monarch spring migrations and their Asclepias host plants using maximum entropy species distribution models.... Finally, I examined how climate change might influence the monthly distribution of both Asclepias and monarchs during their northward migration from March—June.

Bright & Smithson (2001) suggested that reintroductions can be compared with species’ invasions. We accept this analogy, but in a different sense: whereas Bright & Smithson focused on establishment and spread, we consider niche suitability of the region for the species (Peterson & Vieglais, 2001; Peterson, 2003a). This step, which Bright & Smithson subsumed in ‘establishment,’ is nevertheless key in making an invasion, or reintroduction, successful (Wolf et al., 1998). Moreover, the techniques we apply are broadly applicable, including to species so poorly known biologically that habitat suitability approaches would not be applicable (Peterson et al., 2002b). We illustrate this approach with the examples of the California condor Gymnogyps californianus and Mexican wolf Canis lupus baileyi in Mexico, for which reintroduction programmes are in the planning stages",0,NA,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We posed the following questions: Can medium-spatial-resolution satellite imagery be combined with topographic descriptors derived from a DEM to map the patch-level occurrence of WBP with reasonable accuracies? Would one of logistic regression analysis or CTA stand out as a superior strategy for modeling WBP presence and absence? The second objective of this work was to contribute to ongoing conservation efforts by mapping the distribution of WBP across Waterton Lakes National Park, where the species is experiencing high rates of blister rust infection. A high-quality map of stand-level WBP occurrence does not presently exist in the area and would provide both a valuable tool for guiding proactive intervention programs and a solid foundation for conducting future studies designed to clarify the role of the species in the Waterton ecosystem. In general, we hope that this effort will help establish a foundation that leads to subsequent interagency efforts aimed at mapping the distribution of WBP across its entire Canadian range.",0,NA,1,NA,0,NA,0,NA,NA,0,NA,"3","1",NA,NA,4,"Waterton Lakes National Park, AB, Canada","1","0","0","1","0","0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,1,1

Estimating future distributional changes of species under various climate scenarios is of particular interest in the regions expected to experience strong effects of climate change, like boreal forest and tundra biomes (Hof et al. 2012). In this study, we calculated changes in potential distributions of apex preda-tor and mesopredator carnivoran mammals in the boreal forests and tundras of North America under four future greenhouse gas emission scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The species selected for this study are currently distributed mostly (an average 78% of species’ range) in tundra and boreal forest biomes in North America (above 45° N). We used ecolgical niche modeling to estimate future potential distributions of apex predators and mesopredators and calculated distributional changes that could be experienced by these species by 2050 and 2070. Changes in the distribution of apex predators and mesopredators could influence the structure of mammal communities and ecosystem functioning in the future.",0,NA,0,NA,1,1,0,1,1,0,1

We then mapped current BSSP breeding and foraging habitat at six estuarine sites by applying the elevation-suitability model to digital elevation models.

Using reconstructions of past geographic distributions (i.e., natural ranges) for 146 extant terrestrial large-bodied (>44 kg) mammals, we estimate their climatic niches as if they had retained their original distributions and evaluate their observed niche dynamics. We found that range contractions led to a sizeable under-representation of the realized niches of several species (i.e., niche unfilling).

For those species, conservation strategies supported by current ranges risk being misguided if current, suboptimal habitats are considered baseline for future restoration actions. Because most climate-based biodiversity forecasts rely exclusively on current occurrence records, we went on to test the effect of neglecting historical information on estimates of species’ potential distribution – as a proxy of sensitivity to climate change. We found that niche unfilling driven by past range contraction leads to an overestimation of sensitivity to future climatic change, resulting in 50% higher rates of global extinction, and underestimating the potential for mega-fauna conservation and restoration under future climate change.
